/**
 * This exception is thrown when a user tries to equip a virtual good which he/she does not own.
 *
 * Real Game Example:
 *  Example Inventory: { currency_coin: 100, robot_character: 3 }
 *  Suppose that your user would like to equip (LOCAL) a robot_character.
 *  You'll probably call <code>equipVirtualGood("robot_character")</code>.
 *  <code>NotEnoughGoodException</code> will be thrown with "robot_character" as the itemId.
 *  You can catch this exception in order to notify the user that he/she doesn't
 *  own a robot_character (so he/she cannot equip it!).
